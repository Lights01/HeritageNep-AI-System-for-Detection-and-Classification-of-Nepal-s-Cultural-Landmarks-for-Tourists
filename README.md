2. Load the dataset into the code.
3. For testing, provide path to your own desired image.
4. Or, replace the code for it with "test_image_path = random.choice(test_data.filepaths)" for evaluating the model on splitted training dataset.
5. Evaluate or modify the model based on the accuracy of prediction.
